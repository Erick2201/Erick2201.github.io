	<P>Soccer has long been one of the most popular sports in the world. With origins that date back many centuries, soccer is played by young children, college students and professionals. Amateur clubs and weekend warriors add to the passion that swells up every four years for the most-watched sporting event in the world, the World Cup.
	It's a combination of a few things.

<p>It's cheap to play and can be played almost anywhere. The field can be almost any size and be of any material (grass, gravel, sand, concrete...) and anything that can be kicked can be used as the ball. You can use jumpers for goalposts and that's all the equipment you need. So even the poorest people can play and train it. Many other sports are inaccesible to many people either because of cost or other requirements. For instance any winter sports would be hard for many people to practice.  

Football happened to be the favourite past-time of the British workers in the late 1900's when the British navy was at it's strongest. The other British sports at the time, cricket and rugby, were practised by the upper classes while football was very popular among the working classes which the seamen were part of. So they took their hobby all around the world, starting with Europe. Soon South America followed. Africa took a bit longer to follow (AFAIK), but because of the game's easy access it has been very popular in many African countries as well.</p>

<section id="why">
<P>Why soccer is the best sport?</P>
	<div> Anyone can play the sport. It doesn't matter if you're scrawny and 5'2". It doesn't matter if you're 6'7" and have biceps the size of my head. It's such a great game for anyone to play. You don't even need proper equipment. You can play at the beach, with a volleyball, barefoot, and have your goalposts be two backpacks. You can play by yourself, just by juggling the ball. It's easily the world's sport, other than America. Which is a true shame because most people are so ignorant that they take soccer as just "another" sport. That is the biggest lie I could ever hear. It's not just a game, it's a passion.
Sports change us as humans. They can break down the barriers of language, race, creed and colour. We can all enjoy sports together, regardless of what separates us as people. Nothing has demonstrated the equality sports can provide more than football.</div>
